 * The graceful shutdown (SIGTERM from Kubernetes, SIGINT from a terminal), in two parts. First the drain: readiness
 * answers 503 at once and the service keeps working for `delayMs`, because the load balancer needs a moment to stop
 * sending requests (without it, the requests that arrive while the server closes fail with 502). Then the steps run
 * one after the other: stop accepting requests, finish the ones in flight, stop the two loops, close the broker and
 * the pool. A timer started with the drain ends the process with 1 when all that takes longer than `delayMs` plus
 * `timeoutMs`; it does not keep the process alive. A step that fails ends the process with 1 too, and the steps
 * after it do not run. A second signal changes nothing.
 *
 * It takes its dependencies instead of reaching for them, so that the order and the timing are tested with fake timers.
